This is a movie/tv search app using TMDB api. The intent of this project was to learn about working with API data and delve into the world of asynchronous javascript. It is still a work in progress, but is currently somewhat functional. 

Current issues:
-The results slider isn't finished and needs to be completed as it doesn't loop and runs endlessly. 
-The slider also needs to be tweaked to properly center searches that only return a few results. This is a fairly simple fix with css and js.

Future additions:
Expand to allow user to search by genre
Expand to allow user to search by people (actors, director etc..)
Expand to allow user to search trending shows and movies
Expand into a full stack application with the ability to set up user account, save/delete results and see results based off of liked lists etc..
