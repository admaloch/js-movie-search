Movie search app created using OMDB api

This is a work in progress..

The intent of this project was to learn about working with API data and delve into the world of asynchronous javascript. It is still a work in progress, but is currently functional. 

Issues:
-The results slider isnâ€™t finished so it runs endlessly..
-The slider also needs to be tweaked to properly center searches that only return a few results. This is a fairly simple fix with css and js.

Future additions:
Expand to allow user to 
-search by genre
-search by people (actors, director etc..)
-search trending shows and movies
-Expand into a full stack application with the ability to set up user account, save/delete results and see results based off of liked lists etc..
