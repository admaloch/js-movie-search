Movie search app created using OMDB api

The intent of this project was to learn about working with APIs and delve into the world of asynchronous javascript.

Future additions:

Expand to allow user to search by genre, people (actors, director etc.) and trending shows/movies.

I also am interested in expanding to give the user the ability to set up an account, save/delete results and see results based off of liked lists etc.
