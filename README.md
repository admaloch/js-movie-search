# JS-movie-search

<b>About this Project:</b><br/>
This is a movie search app built with Vanilla JS that enables users to search for movies, TV shows, or both. The movie data is sourced from the OMDB API. The intent of this project was to gain practice with asynchronous JavaScript and working with APIs.

<b>Technologies Used:</b><br/>
--JavaScript<br/>
--[OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)<br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/>
The most significant takeaway from this project was gaining hands on experience working with asynchronous JavaScript. This proved particularly challenging when encountering situations where data didn't exist yet. Resolving these issues enhanced my comprehension of how asynchronous functions operate and how to utilize them effectively. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of related concepts such as working with promises, the call stack, and the browser's role in handling asynchronous operations.

<b>Current Status:</b><br/>
The project is complete; however, it has been reconstructed using React. Explore the React version [here](https://github.com/admaloch/react-movie-search).

<b>Note:</b><br/>
This app features a search input that triggers API calls on key presses. However, please note that OMDB restricts requests if the response yields too many results, allowing searches with three letters or more.
