# React-movie-search

<b>About this project:</b><br/> 
This is a movie search app built with vanilla JS that allows you to search for movies, tv shows or both. The movie data is from OMDB API. The intent of this project was to get some practice with asynchronous Javascript and working with APIs.

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/> 
--JavaScript<br/>
--OMDB API: https://www.omdbapi.com/<br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/> 
The biggest takeaway of this project was learning about asynchronous javascript. 

<b>Current status:</b><br/> 
The project is currently finished.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
This app has a search input that runs api calls on key press, but OMDB prevents that if the request returns too many results so it only works with 3 letters or more.
